        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            Go, an ancient Chinese strategy board game, is played between two 
            opponents and can be played on various sizes of boards, though the
            tradition is a 19x19 board. Each player plays with their respective
            white or black stones, referred to as armies. Armies can only be
            placed on intersecting points of the board, known as liberties.
            The four corners of the board , and the intersecting points along the
            edges of the board are also considered liberties.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="section2" class="container-fluid">
        <h1>An Armies Life and Death</h1>
        <p>
            By tradition, the player with black armies gets the first turn. Weaker
            players are typically given black armies as there is an allowed
            advantage. Black can be given an advantage, in which they are
            permitted to place one or more armies at liberties on the board before
            their first turn, this is called a handicap. At each turn each player
            can choose to place an army or pass. Each player is only allowed to
            set one army per turn and armies cannot be moved after placement. An
            “alive” army is one that has at least one open liberty directly
            adjacent to it, that is, there is at least one open liberty at any of
            the positions above, below, leftward or rightward of the army. A chain
            of armies is held to the same standard, that is, a chain of connected 
            armies is alive if there is at least one open liberty directly
            adjacent to any point in the chain. If all of an armies adjacent
            liberties are occupied by enemy armies, the army is no longer
            considered alive and is removed from the board. A chain of armies is
            held to the same standard, that is, if all of the liberties adjacent
            to a chain of armies are occupied by the enemy, the entire chain is
            dead and removed from the board.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="section3" class="container-fluid">
        <h1>KO</h1>
        <p>
            Ko is a rule that reduces repetitiveness in the game. Ko states that no
            moves shall be made that will return the game to a previous state. An
            example of this is shown in Figure 1, where the spot labeled 1 marks the
            unplayable spot. This spot is where, in the previous turn, black
            exhausted all of white's liberties, in turn killing a white army. You
            can see that, in this turn,  if white were to place an army on 1, the
            black army would be dead and the game would return to a  previous state,
            forbidden by ko.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="section4" class="container-fluid">
        <h1>Scoring</h1>
        <p>
            The game is played until such a point that both player no longer have
            any moves to make that would benefit them. This is determined by two
            consecutive passes, that is, both players pass instead placing an
            army. After the game is over, a scoring technique is used to determine
            the winner. There are three scoring techniques; Territory, Area and
            Army scoring.
        </p>
      
      <h3>
        Territory Scoring
      </h3>
      <p>
        In territory scoring, at the end of the game, the score is determined by
        the number of liberties you have completely surrounded by your stones
        minus the number of stones killed during the game.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Area Scoring
      </h3>
      <p>
        In area scoring, the score is determined by the number of stones you
        have left on the board plus the number of empty spaces you have
        completely surrounded by stones. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        Army Scoring
      </h3>
      <p>
        In army scoring the score is determined only by the number of armies
        each player has on the board. The liberties surrounded and armies lost
        do not play a role in the overall score calculation.
