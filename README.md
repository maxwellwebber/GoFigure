Welcome to Go Figure implentation of a Go Game Wep App!


## Running the server


1) Run

    $ npm install 

2)Launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://team-go-figure-exburt.c9users.io/' if running from cloud 9.

NOTE: 
If running local then go to

    $ localhost:port

 Port should be changed in the server.js file to any other port as its currently set to 80 for cloud 9, or ran with root priviliges.
